Very simple example showing how to use the SmartPlug API to set the schedule of one day.

"""

# import plug API
from ediplug.smartplug import SmartPlug

# create plug object for plug with given IP, login admin and password 1234
p = SmartPlug("192.168.1.117", ('admin', '1234'))

# write schedule for one day to plug (Saturday, 11:15 - 11:45)
p.schedule = {'state': 'ON', 'sched': [[[11, 15], [11, 45]]], 'day': 6}
